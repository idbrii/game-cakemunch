* About
Cakemunch is a minesports game about passing to mirror versions of yourself.

Cakemunch was my idea based on Pyre: you control one player and not the
  others. But instead of switching on pass, the others are controlled by your
  opponent.

You and an opponent face off 1 on 1. You can pass up or down to your
  "teammates" who are always positioned above/below your opponent. Your
  passes will rebound off the wall in front of your teammate for you to
  retrieve.

I think there was supposed to be some kind of attack/check move when you
  don't have the ball.

* Title
The name comes from lore. I wanted to have you passing a cake around and you
  needed to feed it to the monster that is the opponent's goal.
